# Pomodoro

Implementation of a timer for the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), in a single file web page.

A sound that plays is stored at [./alert.wav](./alert.wav) - this will need to be adjacent to the html file offline, if sound is desired.

Can be accessed at https://chrispritchard.github.io/pomodoro.
